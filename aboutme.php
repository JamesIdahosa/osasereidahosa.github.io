<h3 class="aboutmeheader">About</h3>
<p class="aboutmeinfo">
	From a young age I have always been interested in computer science. When I was a kid I used to hang out with my friends 
	playing old school flash videogames on the internet at our local library and it was really fun and I have always wanted to 
	know how the internet works. This desire and passion for knowledge inspired me to study hard in school and learn more about 
	computers and how the internet really works. 
</p>

<p class="aboutmeinfo">
	On June 2019 after years of hardwork in school I graduated from Carleton University with a degree in computer science. 
	This was a major accomplishment in my young career and after graduation I decided to accomplish my childhood dream of creating an 
	online game on the internet. On February 2021 I completed my childhood goal by releasing my first ever game on the Steam store 
	page called "Angry Angry Shark''. My game was very successful and got a lot of positive reviews from fans. This achievement along 
	with the knowledge I have acquired from my time at university gave me a lot of confidence to pursue whatever future goals I set my 
	mind to. My next goal as a young man in my career is to work for an established software developing company so that I can be able 
	to take care of my parents when they get old. I have a solid understanding of software developing concepts such as MVC, data structures,
	APIs, OOP principles, and many more.
